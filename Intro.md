# Intro

The world of Holoth is doing pretty dang great. Or at least it is when you compare it to the shattered world that could've been. You see, 721 years ago, a band of eclectic time travelling adventurers arrived to prevent the cataclysm they'd seen in their time. Luckily for us, they succeeded. Unfortunately for everyone, they called themselves the Phlugelmuffins, and we kinda just have to live with that now.

Their influence is inescapable. From the ever-popular CBL (Combat Ball League) to the venerable Vanareth University, their mark on Holoth is indelible.

Perhaps you too will leave a lasting impact on this world. But for now, you are all just crewmates on an up-and-coming expedition team, travelling the realm in search of its mysteries. 

Your next stop? The fabled Verdilwood, and whatever secreted ruins lie within.
