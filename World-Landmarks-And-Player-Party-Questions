# Holoth Landmarks and Organizations

### Combat Ball League
  - Founded by PM (Phlugelmuffins) alum Wulad Molavakri
  - Two goals, one ball, anything goes
  - Clerics are always on standby in case of any untimely death

### Vanareth University
  - Founded by PM alum Prof. Dargrin Vanareth
  - The most prestigious arcane university in the land
  - Their real pride is their artificery college, where Prof. Vanareth himself once taught

### The Brotherhood of Blood
  - Founded by PM alum Bevit
  - Dedicated to protecting the realm from the shadows in its periphery
  - Practices hemocraft, blood magic

### All Super Holoth (ASH)
  - Founded by PM alum Khizis "The Ambassador" Jehmaxath
  - The premiere professional wrestling league that travels the realm

### Amin
  - A monstrous, layered city that covers ~30% of the world
  - Think Ravnica from Magic the Gathering
  - Full of political intrigue and secretive warring factions
  - Home to the landmark churches of most god worship in Holoth
  - There used to be a monarch but today things are slightly more democratic
  - The class struggle here is honestly gross
  - The rich lie on the upper layers of this escherian mess while the poor reside lower, where the sun rarely reaches

### Nima
  - If Amin is a mountain of a city, then Nima is it's mirror
  - A massive stalactite city that hangs above a glittering underdark ocean
  - A wretched give of scum and villainy
  - The criminal underworld of Nima
  - Both cities are trapped in a dangerously codependent relationship

### Idle Bluff
- Where our story begins
- A small town that sits on the northern edge of Amin (it was recently annexed by the city)
- Past the urban landscape are large swathes of farmland
- And past that farmland, the Verdilwood

### Earth's Edge
- Island town just off the shore of northern coast
- Main feature is a large caldera and the colorful houses that line its outside perimeter
- Has the largest population of Tritons in Holoth
- Home to the ASH Championship arena, which sits inside the caldera
- Also home to the Hunter's Guild Headquarters

### The Hunter's Guild
- An adventurer's guild with a network all across the realm
- Acts as a middleman connecting patrons with adventurers
- In the past has also organized defense of the realm in times of need

### The Oldhome Mountains
- Home to an ancient white dragon and their kobold cadres
- Supposedly full of frozen treasure (and also many frozen adventurer bodies)


# PC Guidance and Questions 
- All PCs are specialists comprising an eclectic expedition team (think of the crew from Atlantis)
- Since this is a spacefaring campaign, we will not be spending much time on Holoth at all, so don't tie your character's motivations/goals to something on Holoth. (e.g., don't make your goal "I want to make enough money to support my village", instead do something like "I want to support those that need it wherever I go")
- What is your specialization on the team?
- How did you join the team?
- Were you a co-founder?
- Why did you join the team?
- Who on the team do you admire?
- Who on the team needs your help?


# Party Questions
- What are you called? Are you contractors or do you do it for yourselves? Does the team have a leader or is it a flat hierarchy?
- What's your biggest success so far?
- What's your biggest failure?
